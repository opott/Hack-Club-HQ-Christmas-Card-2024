          To everybody at HQ,
          <br />
          I discovered Hack Club early this year and decided to join to see what
          it was all about. I am absolutely amazed by the generosity of you all.
          It must take a lot of time, effort, and resources to give out all
          these fantastic prizes, and I greatly appreciate it!
          <br />
          Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
        </p>

          <br />
          Thanks to all of you for encouraging me and other teens to start
          coding! It's been great watching Hack Club grow with each event and I
          can't wait to see what others you'll hold in the future!
          <br />
          Cheers!
